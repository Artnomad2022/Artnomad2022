Teaching the model the basic skills of generalization, analysis and generation of qualitative reasoning based
on the available information in such areas as: logic, philosophy, critical thinking, 
the strategy of cooperation and mercy for sapiens, humor, the fundamentals of the philosophy of culture and design.
